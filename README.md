### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

- :pencil2: 
I'm studying my final semester in the Informatics program with a focus on systems development at Mid Sweden University.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a website that teaches basics of API in Swedish.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a bit of php.
- :blue_heart: My heart beats a little extra for frontend development, outdoor life and cooking.
